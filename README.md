# Streamlit Sensor Data Analysis and Chat App

An interactive and intelligent web application built with Streamlit, designed to analyze and generate insights from real-time sensor data. This app combines advanced data retrieval, natural language processing, and data visualization to provide actionable insights and an intuitive chat-based querying system. By leveraging modern data tools, the app helps users track, query, and understand environmental sensor data in a conversational and visual format.

## Key Features

### 1. Insight Generation
The **Insight Generation** feature enables users to visualize real-time and historical data from various environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, AQI, and CO2 levels). With interactive charts, users can:

- Monitor environmental changes and identify trends or anomalies.
- Gain quick insights into the state of each sensor and its recorded data.
- Understand how various environmental factors correlate over time.

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chat
The **RAG-based chat** feature combines data retrieval and language generation to answer user questions related to sensor data. This enables users to interact conversationally with the data, making it easy to access specific information without sifting through raw datasets. Users can ask questions like:

- "What was the highest temperature recorded last week?"
- "How has the air quality varied over the past month?"

Using **LangChain**, the chat system efficiently retrieves relevant data and generates responses, helping users access insights quickly and naturally.

## Importance of the App

With climate change and pollution on the rise, real-time monitoring of environmental data has become critical. This app empowers researchers, organizations, and individuals to:

- **Track Air Quality**: Monitor pollutants like AQI and CO2 levels and understand their health impact.
- **Promote Environmental Awareness**: The accessible data insights encourage proactive steps toward environmental improvement.
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Real-time and historical data help optimize environmental conditions, detect risks, and take informed action.
- **Support Education and Research**: An invaluable tool for students, environmental scientists, and researchers who need real-world data.

## Technologies and Tools Used

This app integrates a variety of powerful tools for data storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization:

### MongoDB Atlas
MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud-based NoSQL database for storing sensor data. MongoDB's flexible schema and powerful querying capabilities make it ideal for handling sensor data with diverse structures. **MongoDB Atlas** also provides cloud-native data services, making it easy to deploy, manage, and scale our database.

### MongoDB Vector
The app leverages **MongoDB Vector** search capabilities to store vector embeddings for text and sensor data, enabling efficient similarity-based querying. This makes it possible to implement intelligent search functionality, helping the RAG system retrieve the most relevant data when responding to user questions.

### AWS Bedrock
**Amazon Bedrock** is used as a foundation for generating language-based insights, powering the RAG model's response generation. By leveraging Bedrock's pre-trained foundation models, the app can understand and generate context-aware responses based on sensor data, ensuring accurate and natural answers to user queries.

### LangChain
**LangChain** is a framework that allows easy integration of large language models (LLMs) with custom data. In this app, LangChain supports the RAG-based chat system, enabling the integration of MongoDB data with AWS Bedrock to create a seamless question-answering system. LangChain simplifies retrieval and language generation, enhancing the system's ability to answer complex questions based on sensor data.

### Streamlit
**Streamlit** is a Python-based framework used to create the app's user interface. Streamlit allows for quick and interactive development of data-driven applications, enabling users to visualize insights, interact with the RAG-based chat, and navigate the app intuitively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB Atlas account
